## üéØ Project Motivation

With the rise of DeepFake technology, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and manipulated images. This poses significant risks in journalism, security, and public trust. Our goal is to develop a robust system that can detect DeepFake images using deep learning techniques.

## üßæ Problem Statement

Develop a deep learning model to classify images as **real** or **fake**, leveraging different architectures including:

* Simple CNN
* VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
* Dual-Stream Custom CNN
* Dual-Stream EfficientNet
